– The programming language we use
	C++
	
– How to complile and execute the program.
	To compile, simply, type 'make' at the terminal (without the quotes).
	Command to execute the program: ./cipher <CIPHER NAME> <KEY> <ENC/DEC> <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>
	where
	CIPHER NAME: is the name of the cipher.  Valid names are:
		DES: Data Encryption Standard
	  	RSA: RSA Algorithm

	KEY: the encryption key to use
	ENC/DEC: whether to encrypt or decrypt, respectively.
	INPUT FILE: the file from which to read the input.
	OUTPUT FILE: the file to which the output shall be written

	Ex:
	For DES,
	./cipher DES 0123456789abcdef ENC big.txt a.txt
	./cipher DES 0123456789abcdef DEC a.txt b.txt

	For RSA,
	./cipher RSA privkey.pem ENC big.txt a.txt
	./cipher RSA pubkey.pem DEC a.txt b.txt

– We implemented the extra credit in a separated folder called Extra_Credit
	In order to run CBC and CFB, first type 'make' at the terminal (without the quotes).
	Command to execute the program: ./cipher DES <KEY> <ENC/DEC> <CBC/CFB> <INPUTFILE> <OUTPUT FILE>
	
	KEY: the encryption key to use
	ENC/DEC: whether to encrypt or decrypt, respectively.
	CBC/CFB: whether to use Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) or Cipher Feedback (CFB) mode
	INPUT FILE: the file from which to read the input.
	OUTPUT FILE: the file to which the output shall be written
	
	Ex:
	For CBC,
	./cipher DES 0123456789abcdef ENC CBC big.txt a.txt
	./cipher DES 0123456789abcdef DEC CBC a.txt b.txt

	For CFB,
	./cipher DES 0123456789abcdef ENC CFB big.txt a.txt
	./cipher DES 0123456789abcdef DEC CFB a.txt b.txt

– Anything special about your submission that we should take note of.
